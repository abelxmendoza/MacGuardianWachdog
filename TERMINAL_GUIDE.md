# 🖥️ How to Use Terminal (Simple Guide)

## What is Terminal?

Terminal is a built-in app on your Mac that lets you run commands. Think of it as a text-based way to control your computer.

## Finding Terminal

1. Press `Command + Space` (opens Spotlight search)
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

Or:
1. Open Finder
2. Go to Applications → Utilities
3. Double-click "Terminal"

## Running MacGuardian Commands

### Easy Way (From the App):

1. **In MacGuardian Suite app**, find the tool you want to run
2. Look for the **"Open Terminal"** button (purple button)
3. Click it - Terminal will open automatically with the command ready!
4. Press **Enter** to run
5. If it asks for your password, type it and press Enter

### Manual Way:

1. Open Terminal (see above)
2. Copy the command shown in the app
3. Paste it into Terminal (Command + V)
4. Press Enter
5. Enter your password if asked

## Common Questions

### "It's asking for my password"
- This is normal! Some security checks need administrator access
- Type your Mac login password (you won't see it as you type - that's normal)
- Press Enter

### "What if I make a mistake?"
- Press `Control + C` to stop a running command
- You can always run it again

### "The command looks scary"
- Don't worry! The commands are safe
- They're the same commands the app would run
- Terminal just gives you more control

### "Can I break my Mac?"
- The commands shown are safe
- They're the same ones the app uses
- If you're unsure, stick to using the app's "Run Module" button

## Step-by-Step Example

**Running mac_guardian.sh:**

1. Open MacGuardian Suite app
2. Click on "Run mac_guardian.sh" in the sidebar
3. You'll see a purple "Open Terminal" button
4. Click it
5. Terminal opens with: `cd '/Users/yourname/Desktop/MacGuardianProject/MacGuardianSuite' && sudo ./'mac_guardian.sh' --resume`
6. Press Enter
7. Enter your password when asked
8. Watch it run!

## Tips

- ✅ **Terminal is safe** - It's just another way to run commands
- ✅ **You can close Terminal** anytime (Command + Q)
- ✅ **Copy/paste works** - Command + C to copy, Command + V to paste
- ✅ **Scroll up** to see previous output (use mouse or trackpad)

## Need Help?

If something goes wrong:
